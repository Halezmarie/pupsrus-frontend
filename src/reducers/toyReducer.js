// will be responsible for updating the parts of the store that deal with the toys

// reducer is a function
//the reducer will take in the state as in the previous state as the first argument and in argument action as the second inside the reducer, then I will update the reducer according to the action type.

// pass in state and then set the initial state so it is like an array, so I can have an object key pointing to an array
